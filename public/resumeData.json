    "bio":"I was raised in Huntington Woods, Michigan, and have been working with computers ever since my parents brought home a computer running Windows XP. Since then a lot has changed (I prefer a unix-based OS), and my passion for computers and technology has only grown stronger. Being a self taught DJ and Graphic Designer, combined with graduating college with a degree in computer science has really provided me with a vast set of skills. And I aim to use those skills each and every day to try and make an impact in the world.",
